## Purpose
The goal of this repository is my take of the completion of the homework assignments for this course.  The reader should keep in mind that I do not claim ownership to any of the starter code provided by the course.  These files are on here simply for educational purpose and for me to keep track of my own progress.

## Usage
The reader should obtain a copy of the latest version of Matlab and/or Octave.  I have personally used Octave to complete these homework assignments.  Follow the included *.pdf for intersuctions.  Most of these assignments can be run by loading the ex*.m file.
